# hello-world
The first repo., where to store ideas, resources, or share and discuss things with others.
# I am writing here to give a brief introduction about me. The reason I start to work here lies in that I am trying to opperate GWAS(Genome Wide Association Study) and a guiding tutorial is posted on GitHub. I only know a little bit of linux and am trying to download scripts to runs locally. 
# I wish I could make progress swiftly.
